### 1. What is OTT, and how is it different from traditional broadcasting?

OTT (Over-The-Top) refers to the delivery of video, audio, and other media content directly to consumers over the internet, bypassing traditional distribution methods like cable or satellite television. Popular OTT platforms include Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and YouTube.

Key Differences Between OTT and Traditional Broadcasting:
Delivery Medium:

OTT: Content is streamed over the internet via apps or websites, accessible on various devices like smartphones, smart TVs, tablets, and laptops.
Traditional Broadcasting: Content is transmitted via cable, satellite, or terrestrial (over-the-air) channels.
On-Demand Access:

OTT: Offers on-demand content, allowing users to watch what they want, when they want.
Traditional Broadcasting: Content is scheduled at fixed times, and viewers must tune in live unless they record it.
Platform Independence:

OTT: Can be accessed globally with an internet connection, without being tied to a specific provider or region.
Traditional Broadcasting: Often tied to regional availability and requires specific equipment like a cable box or satellite dish.
Cost Model:

OTT: Usually subscription-based (SVOD, like Netflix), ad-supported (AVOD, like YouTube), or pay-per-view (TVOD, like iTunes rentals).
Traditional Broadcasting: Often bundled as part of a cable/satellite package, with tiered pricing depending on channel offerings.
Personalization:

OTT: Uses algorithms to recommend content based on user preferences and viewing history.
Traditional Broadcasting: Limited personalization; viewers choose from pre-determined schedules.
Content Variety and Originals:

OTT: Focuses on diverse content, including original series, movies, and niche genres that may not fit traditional TV formats.
Traditional Broadcasting: Primarily relies on licensed or syndicated programming and live broadcasts (news, sports).
Global Reach:

OTT: Accessible globally, depending on platform availability and licensing agreements.
Traditional Broadcasting: Primarily regional due to different broadcasting standards (e.g., NTSC, PAL).
Summary:
OTT platforms give users more control and flexibility over what, when, and how they consume media, while traditional broadcasting relies on scheduled programming and specific infrastructure. OTTâ€™s rise is closely tied to the increasing accessibility of high-speed internet and changing consumer habits.
